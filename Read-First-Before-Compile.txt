Please do not compile this code at this time. It's under construction.

The following folders have been removed.
They are not used for any real purpose.
The test folders and files are good for testing and proving hash etc.. The connectivity tool was only made to test connections. So those type of test things have been removed for production purposes. Those are only good for educational purposes of the cryptonote code base.
Folders and files removed...
